RAPTOR profiles RNA-seq data characteristics (biological coefficient of variation, sequencing depth, library size distribution, sample size, zero-inflation patterns) and employs a multi-criteria scoring algorithm to recommend optimal pipelines from eight production-ready workflows. The framework also enables comprehensive benchmarking comparing all pipelines on user-specific data, quantifying accuracy, runtime, memory usage, and concordance.","addition_date":"2025-11-14T17:30:28.515260Z","last_update_date":"2025-11-14T17:30:28.518106Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["v2.0.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"RAPTOR","home":"https://bio.tools/raptor-rnaseq","license":"MIT","version":"v2.0.0","summary":"An intelligent framework for RNA-seq analysis pipeline selection and benchmarking.

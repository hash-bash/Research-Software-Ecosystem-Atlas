It enables local computation of key statistics (age, sex, ethnicity) and centralized aggregation to detect imbalances across nodes. Ideal for pre-testing federated analysis pipelines, it provides modular runner and aggregator scripts, with a command-line interface for seamless execution and logging, helping validate dataset representativeness before federated learning or clinical research workflows.","addition_date":"2025-11-03T19:58:30.197476Z","last_update_date":"2025-11-04T21:20:11.065471Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["alfa01"],"collections":["eucaim"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"EUCAIM CDM Federated Unbalance Cheker","home":"https://bio.tools/eucaim-cdm-federated-unbalance-cheker","license":"MIT","version":"alfa01","summary":"EUCAIM CDM Federated Unbalance Checker is a lightweight framework for federating data quality checks across distributed datasets.

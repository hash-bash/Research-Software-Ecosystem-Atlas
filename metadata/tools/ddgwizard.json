The calculated features provide information for the \u2206\u2206G prediction from various perspectives, including the structure and environment of wild-type proteins, structural and environmental changes before and after mutation, mutation types, and evolutionary information. In addition, it provides a feature enriched dataset created using the pipeline, including 15,752 \u2206\u2206G data. Furthermore, it incorporates an accurate \u2206\u2206G prediction model developed with the selected optimal features. The model achieved an R-squared of 0.61 in cross-validation.","addition_date":"2025-10-20T18:45:07.801030Z","last_update_date":"2025-10-21T08:31:14.927713Z"}}}

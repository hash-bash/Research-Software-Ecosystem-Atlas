This assessment of evidence levels can synthesise findings across many exposure factors and outcomes, identify understudied domains in children\u2019s environmental health, highlight emerging concerns, or help perform health impact assessment studies.\n\nMore information about the approach that was developed to extract and summarise the existing evidence about effects of environmental factors on health, is available in a publication by Colzin S et al. (2024).The plausibility database is available in a downloadable table.","addition_date":"2025-10-07T12:16:07.372519Z","last_update_date":"2025-10-07T12:17:05.650534Z"}}}

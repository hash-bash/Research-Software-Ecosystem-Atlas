It takes as input a T2-weighted image and produces a segmentation in the same input format.\n\nThree datasets were used to train this model: ProstateX (n=152), Prostate158 (n=119) and ProstateNet (the ProCAncer-I dataset; n=532). We used the T2-weighted images available in each dataset and trained a standard three-class nnU-Net model with three classes: background, peripheral zone and the combination of the transition and central zones as annotated by radiologists. Using 149 cases from the three previously noted datasets, this model achieved DSC=0.81 (95% CI=[0.59, 0.92]) for PZ and 0.87 (95% CI=[0.60, 0.96]) for CZ+TZ. In a clinical validation using ProCAncer-I data, this model achieved, for PZ and TZ+CZ, DSC=0.65 and DSC=0.77, respectively, comparable to the observed between-radiologist DSC for a subset of cases (DSC=0.61 and DSC=0.73, respectively).","addition_date":"2025-11-07T18:15:49.962044Z","last_update_date":"2025-11-28T12:18:55.232382Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"collections":["EUCAIM"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Prostate zone segmentation tool","home":"https://bio.tools/prostate_zone_segmentation_tool","license":"CC-BY-NC-4.0","summary":"This tool automatically segments the the prostate into two zones: the central and transition zones (TZ+CZ) and the peripheral zone (PZ).

However, existing computational platforms mainly focus on genomic analysis, leaving a gap in the seamless integration of genomic and imaging modalities. Thor is a comprehensive spatial transcriptomics analysis tool designed to bridge this gap by enabling efficient co-analysis of gene expression profiles and high-resolution tissue images. It provides scalable workflows for spatial feature extraction, cell segmentation, gene\u2013spatial correlation, and visualization, facilitating multi-omic insights into tissue architecture and cellular heterogeneity.","addition_date":"2025-10-27T16:15:48.531662Z","last_update_date":"2025-10-27T16:59:57.862356Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Thor","home":"https://bio.tools/Thor","summary":"Spatial transcriptomics integrates transcriptomics data with histological tissue images, offering deeper insights into cellular organization and molecular functions.

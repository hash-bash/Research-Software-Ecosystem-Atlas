Protein networks are an important source of information complementary to sequences, but the use of protein networks has proven to be challenging in the context of machine learning, especially in a cross-species setting. Results. We leveraged the STRING database of protein networks and orthology relations for 1322 eukaryotes to generate network-based cross-species protein embeddings. We did this by first creating species-specific network embeddings and subsequently aligning them based on orthology relations to facilitate direct cross-species comparisons","addition_date":"2025-10-27T16:11:34.389774Z","last_update_date":"2025-10-27T16:11:34.392675Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SPACE","home":"https://bio.tools/string-space","license":"MIT","summary":"STRING proteins as complementary embeddings.\n\nMotivation Representation learning has revolutionized sequence-based prediction of protein function and subcellular localization.

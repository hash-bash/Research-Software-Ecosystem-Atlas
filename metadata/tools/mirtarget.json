The target prediction is based on four dataset categories: mRNA profiling in cells or mice after (1) ectopic miRNA expression or (2) miRNA inactivation by knock-out or knock-down, (3) correlation analyses of mRNA and miRNA expression profiles, and (4) ten computational miRNA target prediction algorithms.","addition_date":"2025-10-08T12:52:22.479733Z","last_update_date":"2025-10-08T12:52:22.481900Z"}}}
